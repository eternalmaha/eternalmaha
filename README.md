ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maha Ahmed. I'm a full stack software developer. ðŸŒ±  I recently completed The COLLAB LAB, where I co-developed GrocerEase, a smart shopping list application that makes shopping easier by tracking users shopping history in order to calculate their next purchase dates. The COLLAB LAB was a unique, invaluable experience where I learned the full scale of collaboration on a full stack application with a software development team! I worked with a talented group of curious and supportive developers!

As a self proscribed "internet kid", I enjoy the brain tease of figuring out the logic of building programs. As I mature, I come to view sotware development as largely a "thinking" field. The hunger to solve the task at hand is necessary and part of the fun challenge! I strive to continue learning and experimenting with new problems to flex my thinking muscles!
